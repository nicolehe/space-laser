Space Laser is a physical alien shooting game in which you have 30 seconds to hit five aliens with your laser. If you successfully hit an alien's target, their lit eyes will dim and they will make a sad sound. 

The files in this repo include the Arduino code for the laser, the lights/speaker on the target board, and the moving planets. 

The game was built with 3 Arduinos, 3 batteries, 10 LEDs, 5 photocells, 5 servos, 1 laser diode, 1 speaker, and way too many wires.
